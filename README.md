# Laravel 5.4 - Restore crashed database data trait

## Scenario details: ##

A monolithic application crashes on Friday evening.
The latest snapshot is from Thursday.
The snapshot from Thursday is applied after the crash.
Happily, the crashed database is successfully retrieved from the crashed server.
However, the restored application database is behind the crashed database.
Also, new data is constantly submitted to the restored database from Thursday that is now the operational production database.
Thus, there is a one day gap between the crashed and restored database.

The Task is the missing data from Friday to be smoothly and correctly restored to the new operational database.

All the foreign keys should be properly updated with their new related rows IDs.

Only not updated rows after the snapshot apply should be updated.

## Steps for successful completion ##

1. The start and the end of the data gap in the database should be carefully inspected for each table.
2. All restore steps of the database tablse should be planned according to the foreign keys and their dependencies.
3. All the restore steps in Laravel should be separated to single Laravel Commands and one trait containing all the logic.
4. The restore logic should be maximum abstract.
5. All the commands should be manually executed from the console.
6. Supervisor (if any) should be stopped.
7. Application should be put in a maintenance mode - php artisan down.
8. A database dump of the current operational production database should be made.
9. All the commands should be executed with proper Linux user having read/write permissions in the project folder.
10. Add crashed DB connection to env .and config and deploy.
11. Execute restore commands.
12. Remove crashed DB connection from .env and config and deploy.
13. Investigate restored data
14. Start Supervisor (if any)
15. php artisan up
